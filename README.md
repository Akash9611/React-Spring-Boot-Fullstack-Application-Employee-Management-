# React + Spring Boot Employee Management (Fullstack)

This repository contains a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend for a simple Employee Management application.  
Below is an explanation of the backend module that was added and a guide to understand, run, and extend it.

(These files bootstrap a Spring Boot module and configure it to use PostgreSQL for persistence.)

## What changed â€” plain explanation (teacher tone)

- A backend module named `empManagement` was created and initialized as a Spring Boot application.
  - A Maven wrapper and wrapper configuration were added (`mvnw`, `.mvn/wrapper/*`, `pom.xml`) so anyone can build the backend without installing Maven globally.
- A JPA entity `Employee` was added:
  - Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`.
  - Mapped to table `employees`.
  - `email` is configured as `unique` and `nullable = false`.
- `EmployeeRepository` was added as a placeholder interface.
  - Currently a shell; to make it functional, extend a Spring Data interface such as `JpaRepository<Employee, Long>`.
- Database configuration:
  - `application.properties` configures a PostgreSQL connection pointing to `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ems` with user `postgres` and password `root`.
  - `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` will create/update the `employees` table automatically on startup.
- Test scaffolding:
  - A basic Spring Boot test class was added to verify the application context loads.

Why this matters:
- Persistent storage: switching to PostgreSQL allows data to survive restarts and is suitable for development and staging.
- Reproducible builds: the Maven wrapper ensures contributors can build the project consistently.
- Foundation for CRUD: the Employee entity is the starting point for service and controller layers and for wiring the frontend.

## How to run the backend locally (step-by-step)

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running locally and create a database named `ems`:
   - Example (Linux/macOS with psql):
     - sudo -u postgres psql
     - CREATE DATABASE ems;
     - -- If needed, ensure user and password:
       - CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'root';
       - GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ems TO postgres;

   - If you prefer, run Postgres with Docker:
     - docker run --name ems-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root -e POSTGRES_DB=ems -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

2. Start the backend using the included Maven wrapper:
   - cd empManagement
   - On Linux/macOS: ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   - On Windows (cmd): mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

   The application will connect to the configured Postgres DB and Hibernate will create/update the `employees` table.

3. Run tests:
   - ./mvnw test

Notes:
- For security and best practice, do not keep production credentials in plaintext. Use environment variables or externalized configuration for non-development environments.
- If your Postgres instance uses different credentials or host, override properties with environment variables or a profile-specific properties file.

## Quick developer notes and recommended next steps

- Implement a working repository:
  - Replace the placeholder with:
    - `public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> { }`
- Add service and controller layers:
  - Create a service for Employee business logic and a REST controller with endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Validation and error handling:
  - Add DTOs and input validation (e.g., @Email on email field) and centralized error handling for robust APIs.
- Frontend integration:
  - Add or wire a React frontend to call the REST endpoints (list, create, update, delete employees).
- Developer DX:
  - Consider adding a `docker-compose.yml` to bring up Postgres + the app for consistent local dev.
- Production readiness:
  - Replace `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` with controlled migrations (Flyway or Liquibase).
  - Externalize DB credentials and use secrets for CI/CD.

## Short checklist (for immediate follow-ups)
- [ ] Implement/extend EmployeeRepository with JpaRepository.
- [ ] Add EmployeeService and EmployeeController.
- [ ] Add request validation and DTO mapping.
- [ ] Provide Docker Compose for local Postgres.
- [ ] Add sample data or a SQL seed for quick testing.
